<p>ProtoStack is a PHP prototyping framework written by James Welch, so that you can create new prototype web apps in super quick time. Think of ProtoStack as a minimalist cousin to Laravel/CakePHP/CodeIgnighter frameworks - but without any of the pain.</p>
<p>The difference between ProtoStack and the others mentioned is that ProtoStack is very, very small, and easier for amateur coders to start straight away. The components included mean that you can literally have a database-driven site made in minutes. ProtoStack
  has been written by somewhat of an amateur coder (me, James), and so does the basics with little fuss, and doesn't have lots of bloat that can sometimes feel unnecessary.</p>
<p>Included is a template engine, a <a href="https://github.com/derp-all-day/PHD">flat file database engine (PHD)</a>, and the <a href="https://getuikit.com/docs/">UIkit Library</a> so that you can do many CSS/JavaScript things with almost zero coding.</p>
<p>There are no requirements (other than PHP 7+, possibly 5.6+) that are needed. Just upload to a webserver and play!</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Upload the files to your server, in a folder of your choosing, and then edit the inc/settings.php file - and away you go - a teeny tiny PHP framework with optional flat file database. Marvelous!</p>
